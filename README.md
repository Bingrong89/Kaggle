# Kaggle
What remains of my short try with Kaggle
Santander was not even submitted. Kaggle felt more like work instead of an interesting competition... 
Bulk of the challenges I tried were more of fine-tuning, or some form of data exploration challenge... not exactly very stimulating.
There are many neat tricks to learn from the other competitors though, so i guess that's good.
